    I am learning english on the youtube channel [Английский язык по плейлистам](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_3oKG5Szq-m6Xz-MjRZgpw). I'v already watched 643 lessons. They last about 20 minutes. Now i'm doing test on pre-intermediate level. But i don't have of much an experience. So, actually my real level a little lower. But i continue studying. Also i was learning english in duolingo and lingualeo earlier. But it doesn't give me big benefit.
